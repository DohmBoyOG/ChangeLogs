1/4/2021 - Brand New UI, Optimized some of the code

1/7/2021 - New Features: Unlimited Sleigh Fuel and Magic Candy, make sure you have your sleigh already out, you don't have to be riding it just spawn in,
for the Magic Candy Feature, that is just something i added for fun, its the ability to spawn all the minions on the map in one place and kill them
for max candies, i high recommand you have a high damage stat before using this OR you use minion god mode, you also have the ability to spawn the minions
on other players aswell, if your feeling generous, the 'Candy Brick Road' Options spawn the minions in such a way it looks like a road of candy canes, 
the 'Candy Floor' options spawns the minions in such a way that the canes kinda look like a floor underneath you, autobuy coming soon!
